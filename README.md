TerminalBrain is a pretentiously named project that aims to create a terminal application with a relatively intuitive UI with `tui-rs` for configuring and sending prompts to OpenAI's API for GPT-3 based models. Since ChatGPT is not currently available on openAI's API, and Codex, another GPT-3 based model trained to generate and manipulate code, is in beta, the initial release will only work with the Davinci model, but eventually you'll be able to choose any of the models available on the API.
